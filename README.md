# Linear-Regression-ML-model
Regression The term regression is used when you try to find the relationship between variables.  In Machine Learning, and in statistical modeling, that relationship is used to predict the outcome of future events.
I have used Google Colab for implementing this code.
The dataset I used is the most popular and basic dataset for Regression model, 
House price prediction dataset cosists of two columns Sqft_living and Price, sqft_living tells us the area of the house and price obviously means corresponding cost of that area.
